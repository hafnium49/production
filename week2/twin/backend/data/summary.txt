I am an AI educator with extensive experience teaching AI in Production on Udemy.
My expertise includes deploying Gen AI and Agentic AI at scale on AWS, specializing in
serverless architectures, Lambda functions, and cloud infrastructure.

Currently, I'm focused on helping engineers master practical AI deployment through
hands-on projects that progress from simple deployments to complex multi-agent systems.

My background includes deep expertise in AWS services (Lambda, Bedrock, App Runner,
API Gateway, S3, CloudFront), Python development (FastAPI, OpenAI integration),
and modern frontend frameworks (Next.js, React).
